First, read the file two time in different ways, one read two words a time and one read one word a time.

Then count the number and see if it is paired, if paired, then go to PairsFreqsMap, else, go to SingleFreqMap.

Then as the relative frequency defined, wrote the relative frequency of each pair into RelPairFeqMap.

Then sort and get the top 100 pairs into TopHundredMap
